ASTM-style timestamps:

Only a subset of ASTM-3339 conformant timestamps are accepted. They must satisfy the regular expression below.
Note that signed numeric timezones and leap seconds are supported.
Note also that nanosecond resolution is not provided, and that times that differ only in fractions of a second smaller than 1/10000000 will resolve to the same time in the database)
Note finally that timestamps with timezones omit the Z indicator.

^((19|20)[0-9][0-9]-(0[1-9]|1[012])-(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])[Tt]([01][0-9]|2[0-3]):([0-5][0-9]):([0-5][0-9]|60)(\.[0-9]+)?(([Zz])|([\+|\-]([01][b0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9])))$

Database semantics for models.

These are the error messages that might be encountered from submission to the data pipeline, as of 7/23/2020.
They are almost univerally in the form of 
"<ASTM OR X3 MODEL NAME>_<KEY NAME>_<ERROR CONDITION>
or prose-like with model and offending values or referring ids.
