ASTM-style timestamps:

Only a subset of ASTM-3339 conformant timestamps are accepted. They must satisfy the regular expression below.
Note that signed numeric timezones and leap seconds are supported.
Note also that nanosecond resolution is not provided, and that times that differ only in fractions of a second smaller than 1/10000000 will resolve to the same time in the database)
Note finally that timestamps with timezones omit the Z indicator.

^((19|20)[0-9][0-9]-(0[1-9]|1[012])-(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])[Tt]([01][0-9]|2[0-3]):([0-5][0-9]):([0-5][0-9]|60)(\.[0-9]+)?(([Zz])|([\+|\-]([01][b0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9])))$

Database validation semantics for models

These are the error messages that might be encountered during submission to the
data pipeline. They are almost univerally in the form of "<ASTM OR X3 MODEL
NAME>_<KEY NAME>_<ERROR CONDITION> or prose-like with model and offending values
or referring ids. When explanations are provided, they might include a JSON path
from the root of the JSON object to the offending or missing item. Items in
quotes are from descriptions of the ASTM 0.3.5 swagger file or X3 swagger files.
Not all of these diagnostics may be encountered: errors of syntax are likely to
be signaled and the model instance rejected before the faulty model
