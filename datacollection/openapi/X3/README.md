# NASA Data Pipeline for X3 data collection

Data Pipeline models required for the X3 event fall into 2 categories, ASTM-published and NASA-published.  

NASA has defined a small set of changes to the ASTM spec needed for Data Collection.  These are either clarifications in a model's 'description' field or promotions of a property from option to required.  You can use NASA's "Diff URL" to view these additions.

NASA's clarifications to the ASTM interface spec are documented in ![this base doc copied from ASTM](https://github.com/nasa/uam-apis/blob/master/datacollection/nasa-astm-utm.yaml).  You can compare the ASTM interface spec with NASA's clarifications using the above compare URL.
